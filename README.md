# secrets-vault

Keep your app secrets encrypted in-repo, automatically decrypt on local dev or deploy.

Inspired by Rails credentials - it pairs nicely with [mrsk](https://mrsk.dev). But it can be used as a standalone CLI tool or as a library. 

The vault is YAML encoded and encrypted using [AES-GCM-256 authenticated encryption](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/aead/#cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead.AESGCM).

## Quick start

1. Install it:
```bash
$ pip install secrets-vault
```

2. Create a new vault:
 ```bash
$ secrets init

Generated new secrets vault at ./secrets.yml.enc
Generated new master key at ./master.key - keep it safe!
 ``` 

3. Edit secrets:
```bash
$ secrets edit

>> Opening secrets file in editor...

# Add your secrets below, comments are supported too.
# dev:
#     secret-key: abc123
#
# database-url: postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dev
```

4. Read secrets:

```bash
# Via CLI
$ secrets get database-url
> postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dev
```

```python
# In Python
from secrets_vault import SecretsVault

vault = SecretsVault()
foo = vault.get('database-url')
```

**Important:** You should keep the `master.key` secret, do NOT commit it. Ignore it in your `.gitignore` file. The `secrets.yml.enc` file is encrypted and can be committed.

## CLI usage

You can view the help anytime by running `secrets --help`:

## Reading secrets

### CLI commands

List all secrets:

```bash
$ secrets get

# Add your secrets below, comments are supported too.
# dev:
#     secret-key: abc123
#
# database-url: postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dev
```

Get a secret:

```bash
$ secrets get database-url
> postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dev
```

Traverse nested objects:

```bash
$ secrets get

dev:
 secret-key: abc123
 admins: [zero, one, two three]

database-url: postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dev
```

```bash
$ secrets get dev.admins.2

> two
```


### In Python

Simply call `get` with the key. Note that if the secret is missing it will return `None`

```python
from secrets_vault import SecretsVault

vault = SecretsVault()

admins = vault.get('dev.admins')
```


## Editing secrets

### CLI command

You can set secrets from the CLI with a key and value:

```bash
$ secrets set foo bar
```

### Interactive editor

To edit secrets, run `secrets edit`, the file will be decrypted and your editor will open.

```bash
$ secrets edit

>> Opening secrets file in editor...

# Add your secrets below, comments are supported too.
# dev:
#     secret-key: abc123
#
# database-url: postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dev
```

Any saved changes will be encrypted and saved to the file on disk when you close the editor.

### In Python

You can also edit secrets from code:

```python
from secrets_vault import SecretsVault

vault = SecretsVault()
vault.set('foo', 'bar')
vault.save()
```

## Deleting secrets

### CLI command

You can delete secrets from the CLI with a key:

```bash
$ secrets del foo
```

### In Python

You can achieve the same in Python like this:

```python
from secrets_vault import SecretsVault

vault = SecretsVault()
vault.delete('foo')
vault.save()
```


## Printing secrets as environment variables

Sometimes you may want to print a secret as environment variables. It will also apply if you have nested objects. You can do so by running:

```bash
$ secrets edit

aws-credentials:
    aws-access-key-id: abc123
    aws-secret-access-key: abc456
    
database-url: postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dev
```

Envify will print the secrets ready for consumption as environment variables:

```bash
$ secrets envify aws-credentials

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=abc123
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=abc456
```

You can also print the entire vault as environment variables:

```bash
$ secrets envify

AWS_CREDENTIALS={"aws-access-key-id": "abc123", "aws-secret-access-key": "abc456"}
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dev
```

The following conventions are applied:
- The key is uppercased
- Dashes are replaced with underscores
- Values are serialized as plain-text (eg. strings and numbers) 
- Objects are JSON encoded (eg. lists and dicts) 

### Consuming the output of envify

You can then use it in your shell like this:

```bash
$ $(secrets envify --export aws-credentials)
$ echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

abc123
```

Or dump multiple secrets to a dotenv file:

```bash
$ secrets envify aws-credentials >> .env
$ secrets envify database-url >> .env
```

## Providing the master.key file

### File on disk
By default, the vault will look for the master key in a file located at `./master.key`.

### Environment variable
You can also provide it via an environment variable `MASTER_KEY`. For example:

```bash
MASTER_KEY=my-super-secret-master-key secrets edit
```

When a master key is provided via an environment variable, it takes precedence over the file on disk.


### In Python

You can load the master_key from anywhere else and provide it when initializing the class:

```python
from secrets_vault import SecretsVault

# Load from somewhere else
master_key = 'my-super-secret-master-key'

vault = SecretsVault(master_key=master_key)
```

The order of precedence for the master key is:
1. Provided via the constructor
2. Provided via the `MASTER_KEY` environment variable
3. Loaded from the file on disk

## Configuring the default filepaths

### CLI command

You can also provide them as a CLI arguments before the command:

```bash
$ secrets \
  --master-key-filepath ./prod/master.key \
  --secrets-filepath ./prod/secrets.yml.enc \
  init
```

This can be used to separate your secrets by environments such as `prod`, `staging`, `dev`, each having with their own key.

### In Python

You can also configure the filepaths at which your `secrets.yml.enc` and `master.key` files are located.

```python
from secrets_vault import SecretsVault

vault = SecretsVault(master_key_filepath=..., secrets_filepath=...)
```
